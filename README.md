# UCI Income Classification Assignment

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict which income bracket an individual falls into using the UCI adult income dataset. As an additional layer of complexity, this target variable in this dataset contains 3 classes rather than the standard 2. 

Additionally, an important learning objective of this assignment is to implement a variety of models with cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning to identify the best performing model. There is also emphasis on how one would score these models and evaluate their performance. You'll find all the info you need in the iPython Notebook, enjoy!
